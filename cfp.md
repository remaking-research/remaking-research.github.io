# Call for Participation
{:call}

Many voices are converging on key controversies around how we as researchers intervene in the situations that we study, including: legitimation and governance outside technocratic models of expertise, meaningful action toward the climate crisis (when everything appears to be too little too late), and the ensuing collapse of trust in democratic institutions that have failed to exonerate themselves by redressing inequity. A number of scholars have already put forward novel forms of collaboration across disciplinary and institutional lines in order to speak back to these pressing concerns. These alternative collaborations are continually being developed to facilitate asynchronous yet effective contributions within distributed research collectives-- especially at transnational scales. Despite these exciting efforts, the academic institutions and infrastructures supporting research have so far appeared resistant to transformational social change. Remaking research requires epistemological stances that can coherently knit together the empirical and theoretical in order to respond to, and address, tensions such as these.

Research that revisits distinctions between practice and theory has led to reconfigurations of both social and technical protocols that better suit our changing environments. This has meant changing the role of the researchers and the academy to work alongside projects of social change (Irani & Silberman, 2016; Russell, 2015; Stengers, 2015); offering new models of lay and expert collaboration (Feenberg, 2017; Ulrich, 1983); experimenting with forms of collaborative inquiry (Fortun, et al., 2018, Whatmore & Landström, 2011); and offering incremental yet robust examples of doing research differently (Tuck, 2009; Tuck, Wang, and Gaztambide-Fernández, 2018; Costanza-Chock, 2018; Vera, et al., 2018). These explorations undertaken by diverse scholars serve as sites from which future practises of experimentation, intervention, and relation, may be developed...

Join members of the [Philosophy Department of Adam Mickiewicz University (Poznan, Poland)](http://filozofia.amu.edu.pl/en/plany/) and [Faculty of Information at University of Toronto (Toronto, Canada)](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/) for a post-4S/EASST summer school to experiment with new forms of horizontal research bridging diverse theoretical and empirical perspectives. Making the most of the transnational connections established at the 2020 4S/EASST conference in Prague, we will use our time together to foster meaningful collaborative exchanges between early stage researchers from a range of disciplinary backgrounds. We strongly encourage graduate students at all stages to apply.

## Format

A four-day summer school with daily activities including keynotes, seminars, and informal workshops to explore key themes and experiment with collaborative academic infrastructures.

Participants are expected to give a short introductory presentation and to be an engaged contributor throughout.

- Name, Affiliation
- Short Biography (150 words)
- Description of research interests and connection to workshop themes (250 words)
