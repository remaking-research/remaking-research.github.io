    is a PhD Candidate at the University of Toronto Faculty of Information, with an undergraduate background in Philosophy and Political Science. Work in his Master's degree examined the ways in which design features of a government online consultation system transcoded assummptions about ideal citizenship performances and the relation between the state and citizens. Here, discourse analysis and interviews with public servants was used to understand the varying purposes and reasoning of the system's design, but how this vision can become inflected with he worldviews of its developers, and the sponsoring organization. Owing in no small part to the varied nature of his committee and colleagues, this work is situated at the intersection between political theory, communications, critical theory, systems thinking, and science and technology studies.

    is a researcher and PhD candidate at the University of Toronto. Her focus is on the values driving web decentralization projects and the possibilities for social transformation (or pitfalls) posed by these new technologies. Her dissertation traces the networked contingency "decentralization" arises out of at a moment when technologists are using it as a sense-making frame for building and using alternative structures. In addition, she co-organizes Our Networks, an annual conference about the past, present, and future of building community-owned infrastructure, and has been a member of grassroots advocacy and technology projects including the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI), Data Together, and Toronto Mesh. A keen urban agriculturalist, Dawn would rather be in the garden.
